 Analysis of  .  .
On conducting The shapiro-wilk test of normality, the pvalue was= 0.0176525448647641 .

The assumpton of normality of parameter  was violated, hence we conducted Mann-Whitney U test
The Median   in  Diabetic  group  was  34.4  and  inter-quartile range was  17.6 .
The Median  in  Non-Diabetic  group  was  36.55  and  inter-quartile range was  19.53 .
On performing Mann whitney U test there was a statistically  non-significant  difference between two groups.
The p value was  0.7892  .

 Analysis of  .  .
On conducting The shapiro-wilk test of normality, the pvalue was= 0.341393387640645 .

The assumption of normality was preserved

Levene' test for hompgeneity of variances revealed degree of Freedom of  1 98  and  F ratio 0f  0.01 NA .

On conducting levene test for Homogeneity of Variance we found out that assumption of equal variance was True. Hence We conducted equal variance t-test
The Mean +/- SD of  x  in  Diabetic  group  was  47.45  and  standard deviation was  15.24 .
The Mean +/- SD of  x  in  Non-Diabetic  group  was  50.89  and  standard deviation was  15.71 .
On performing   Two Sample t-test  there was a statistically  non-significant  difference between two groups.
The mean  difference between group  Diabetic  and group  Non-Diabetic  was  -3.44  .
The 95 % confidence interval of difference was -9.62  to 2.74  .
The t statistic was -1.11 . The p value was  0.2717  .
