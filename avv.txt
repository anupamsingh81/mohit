Analysis of . .
The Shapiro test for normality was statistically  non-significant with p value of  0.4643714 .The Barlett test for homogeneity of variance  was statistically   significant with p value of  0.03818363 .
The mean of  unstable_angina group was 28 . The SD of  unstable_angina group was 9 .
The mean of  stable_angina group was 40 . The SD of  stable_angina group was 12 .
The mean of  Control group was 65 . The SD of  Control group was 17 .
Since assumptions of normality of residuals were met  but  homogeneity of variance was violated, A one-way between subjects one-way ANOVA with Welch Correction  was conducted to compare the effect of groups on  x 
There was a  statistically significant effect of groups  x at the p<.05 level for all 3  groups .[F( 2 , 22.9650521009793 )= 27.53 ,p = <0.0001 .]
We conducted a priori specifiied Games-Howell test for carrying out multiple post-hoc comparisons between groups 
  P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Output is as follows
